## Unsolved Problems
* Update functionality when double clicking a study item


## Future Enhancements
- Debug update functionality so that when double clicking a study item the boarder becomes framed (when the study item has been completed)
- Improve styling
- Turn it into a full stack application by using a backend such as MongoDB
- Expand the Study-item.ts interface to include more attributes for each study item such as a timer
